// TODO: remove these lines after you have added the Suit and FaceCard enums as per the assessment README
print("There are \(Card.newDeck(aceValue: 1).count) in a deck of cards")
// There are 52 in a deck of cards


// 1. Create an instance of the Game()
let instanceOfGame = Game() // (does this need anything in the () after Game?)

// 2. Call newGame on the newly created instance above.
instanceOfGame.______ = newGame

// 3. Create a gameOver instance and set it to false. This will be used in your repeat-while to determine if game play should stop.
// 4. Use a repeat-while to allow the user options between getting new cards by calling the hitMe() method or passing by calling the stopHits() method.
// 5. When the player has won or lost ask them if they would wish to continue playing another round.
